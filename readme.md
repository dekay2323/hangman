##Development Steps##
- New Computer
- Install Grails
- Install Java
- Create App
- Push to Github
- Branch AddUser
  - Install Security Plugin, which gives User, Role, Secured

 - Main idea
   - /hangman/game/1
   - restful interface into game
   - front end can be html or other
   - game should be generic enough to handle turn based game
   - Basical Diagram
